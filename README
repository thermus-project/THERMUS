Compiling THERMUS and running test programs
===========================================

Configuration and compilation should be done using CMake: source cmakethermus.sh
(Please note that the provided makefiles are not recommended).

For using THERMUS, a ROOT version >= 6 compiled from source is necessary:
you can obtain the source via: git clone http://root.cern.ch/git/root.git root
please look at cmakeroot.sh as an example for properly building and installing root
Note that a rootlogon.C loading THERMUS Shared Object (.so) libraries is also provided.

A simple example script is available in the test directory
